# DiscordRoleBot
Read roles from Streamlabs Chatbot and put them into discord.
To run it:
start ./updateranks
go to discord #test123
type in discord:
!write
this should create a file roles.json
then type in discord
!s
this should create missing roles and assign roles to people in discord
then, we still need to manually sort the roles in discord
